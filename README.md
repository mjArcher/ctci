CTCI
Progress notes

- 24/09/18 
began stack implementation
played with maps
understood differences between cstdlib and stdlib.h
installed valgrind
installed gdb

- 25/09/18
ran valgrind did some memory leak tests
played around with strings - null terminated list of chars
exercise 1.1 done. 

- 26/09/18
hash tables : Don't think I fully understood how these worked beforehand
reviewed asymptotic notation. 
read through some advice on answering questions and committed to github

- 27/09/18
continued stack implementation 

- 28/09/18


- 01/10/18
Linked list implementation - learnt the distinction between stacks and LLs 
add or pop at any point. 
Why would you ever use a linkedlist though?
The doubly linked list would made the code a lot easier.
In the example from ctci, they haven't stored a pointer to head or tail: curious!

- 02/10/18
Went over the Singly linked list implementation again.
